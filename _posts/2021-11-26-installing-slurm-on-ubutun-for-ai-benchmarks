# Context
When running benchmarks you need to find the appropriate library to compete with.
When it comes to AI the standard is [ML commons](https://mlcommons.org) created in 2019 to ease benchmark reproductibility in Machine Learning and AI.

I did a Youtube video regarding this subject explaining ML commons and how benchmarks work:

# Slurm to the rescure
When performing benchmarks is often that you want to test the scale of the GPU, then the machine using multiple GPU then the whole system using mutliple Nodes.

This is where distributed computing comes into play with 2 main components:
- the software libs : Torch distributed/horovod 
- the orchestration : slurm

Slurm was introduced in 2010 for scientific High Performance Computing (HPC).

Slurm allow you to run a coordinated workload on multiple workers.

## Installing slurm on Linux / Ubuntu 20.04

```console

```
